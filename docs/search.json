Where are they seeking and obtaining support now? What are their preferences?\nWhich evidence-based practices are utilized by community-based organizations and providers and have the greatest impact on preventing Veteran suicide?\nWhich emerging innovations are utilized by community-based organizations and providers and show the greatest promise for preventing Veteran suicide?\nWhich evidence-based supports and emerging innovations, in what combination, have the greatest impact on preventing Veteran suicide?\nWhat VA systems, policies, processes, or practices impede Veteran access to and receiving care, including through community-based organizations and providers? What viable, scalable options are likely to produce the best results?"
