## Data sources

If you are not VA-cleared, your team will likely be working with public data sets, available online.

However, please do not allow this to limit your team - search online for accessible data sets that will help you answer your research question. If you have access to another data set you'd like to use, please bring it (assuming you have the appropriate approvals).

## Analytic techniques

Analytic approaches can vary from beginner to advanced and may include the following and many other techniques, tailored to the individual's areas of expertise and skills:

-   data visualization (especially interactive) and tables

-   descriptive statistics and trend analysis

-   geospatial analysis of service access

-   systematic review and meta-analysis

-   machine learning

-   qualitative analysis

Teams will be constructed intentionally to support cohesive analyses as well as staff growth.
