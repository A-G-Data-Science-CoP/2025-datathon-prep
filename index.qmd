title: "Mission: Lifeline Datathon Preparation"
---

Organized by the A-G Associates Data Science Community of Practice, in preparation for our September 2025 Suicide Prevention Month datathon.

::: callout-note
## This datathon will also require expertise in: suicide prevention, veteran and military populations, project management, presentation development, and marketing (optimizing creative outputs for the GitHub and internal presentation). Thus, our non-analytic staff also have a vital role to play!
:::

## Objectives

-   Develop actionable insights and solutions focused on suicide prevention for veterans and active duty military members by integrating data science, qualitative insights, and evidence-based policy research

-   To connect staff across the company with a common goal, using available data and tools, leveraging varied expertise for collaborative learning and innovation in research and data science, thus challenging participants to address real-world problems with data

-   To launch our Data Science Community of Practice GitHub with a portfolio of creative analytic projects based on public data sets, for use as a marketing tool online

-   To familiarize staff with relevant, available data sources - where they are, who owns them, how to access, how we might leverage them, etc.

## Timeline

-   August

    -   Meeting focused on preparation - August 22
        -   CoP leaders will draft team lists with potential research questions, data sources, and analytic techniques; we will use this time to refine these
        -   Participants, please come prepared with your interests and capabilities related to the above

-   September

    -   Execute datathon - September 12 & 19 (two full work days set aside, as participants are able)

    -   Datathon final presentation - September 30 during All Staff meeting

-   October

    -   After marketing approval process is complete, push public portfolio to GitHub

: Datathon roles

## Teams

Participants will be grouped into logical teams based on data accesses, areas of expertise, and their interests. Participants are encouraged to seek out data sets and research questions or themes that they are passionate about and wish to explore.

Teams will be provided with examples of potential data sources, research questions, examples of templated outputs such as this website (created in RStudio, leveraging the A-G brand toolkit), and analytic techniques, as well as as a rubric for structured guidance.

This website is your primary resource for initial guidance, but please use all of your resources (including the internet!) and reach out to other staff as helpful; we have so many internal experts in suicide prevention, military/veteran matters, and analytics.

## Data sources

We can provide a few curated, publicly available data sets, including death data from VA, CDC, and DSPO, as available.

However, please do not allow this to limit your team - search online for accessible data sets that will help you answer your research question. If you have access to another data set you'd like to use, please bring it (assuming you have the appropriate approvals).

## Research questions

We will aim to have suggested research questions for each team by the end of the August CoP meeting, during which each team will meet to prepare.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Goal |
|----|----|
| Contribution to the field | Project contributes meaningfully to suicide prevention analytics beyond currently available research, offering insights or solutions that may have been overlooked in the past, or attacks the problem with a new angle, on a bigger scale, or at a higher level, while accurately reflecting the data |
| Quality control (QC) | A second analyst has independently confirmed the numbers, claims, facts, sources, etc., ensuring that the output is free of errors and clearly conveys all information |
| Next steps | Projects includes nuanced acknowledgement of limitations and suggestions for potential next steps, improvements, and/or implementation of insights/solutions, grounded in data/evidence |
| Internal presentation | Team presents engaging, concise presentation within given time limits, resulting in nuanced discussion; each team member is involved |
| Final output | Output on GitHub (interactive dashboard/application, website, research notebook/report) or Tableau Public (interactive dashboard, data story) reflects A-G's innovative analytic capabilities, exemplifying how data can be used to inform client work; leverages A-G branding |

## Analytic techniques

Analytic approaches can vary from beginner to advanced and may include the following and many other techniques, tailored to the individual's areas of expertise and skills:

-   data visualization (especially interactive) and tables

-   descriptive statistics and trend analysis

-   geospatial analysis of service access

-   systematic review and meta-analysis

-   machine learning

-   qualitative analysis

Teams will be constructed intentionally to support cohesive analyses as well as staff growth.
